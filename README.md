# Homework1
This is a simple project done as my first homework assignment for my computer science class
It contains:
  1. The actual C++ program
  2. The homework assignment
  3. An overview of the process the code was created
  
The center part of the C++ program is not a required part of the assignment. It was done purely for my ammusement and to see if I could.
